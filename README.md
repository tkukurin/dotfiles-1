dotfiles
========
My dotfiles `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. I've tried to use as much native zsh code and as few dependencies as possible. This keeps this setup snappy.

## How Snappy?
```
~  TIMEFMT=$'real %E\tuser %U\tsys %S'
~  repeat 10 {time zsh -i -c exit}
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.02s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.02s      sys 0.02s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.01s
real 0.04s      user 0.03s      sys 0.02s
```

60ms for a tmux pane split is nice :-)

## What does it contain?
* Vim is powered by [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
* Zsh is powered by [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom).
* Tmux bar code is generated by [TmuxLine.vim](https://github.com/edkolev/tmuxline.vim)

This setup will work on both OSX and Linux (and may work on other platforms).

## Requirements
* You have `exa` installed (`ls` replacement, e.g. `cargo install exa`)
* You have `zsh` installed (known to work from 4.3.17 to 5.3.1)
* You have `tmux` installed (`2.1`+ or you will have issues with the supplied `.tmux.conf` )
* You have `vim` installed (optionally compiled with `ruby` and `python` support)
* You have `ruby`, `ruby-devel`, `python` and `python-pip` installed - if you wish to use Command-T plugin in vim
* You will need a [Powerline capable font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
* `Exuberant Ctags`, as TagBar will not work with GNU ctags. On OSX: `brew install ctags` fail.

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/tuurlijk/dotfiles "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/dotfiles"
cd "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/dotfiles"
./setup.sh

chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

The installer will also install `zgenom` for you.

## Troubleshooting
It might be the case that the `Command-T` vim plugin causes a segfault on your system when you use the bootstrap script.
This is due to the fact that it was compiled for a different architecture than your vim.
See the [Command-T manual](http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/command-t.txt) for instructions.

Specifically:

```
 First you have to check the platform Vim was built for:

  vim --version
  ...
  Compilation: gcc ... -arch i386 ...
  ...

and make sure you use the correct ARCHFLAGS during compilation:

  export ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386"
  make
```
